I worked on many projects that involved machine learning and large amounts of data.  Over the years, I observed the same pattern over and over again: At the beginning of a project, progress is rather fast, slowly degrading with every week passing. Eventually, developers (including data scientists and engineers) are less motivated to make changes to the code base as even small tasks feel like a big time investment -- which is most likely a correct statement by then. Even worse, small (but valuable) changes are therefore not prioritised anymore, basically stopping iterative improvements (which is IMHO the requirement for building a great product).

Why does it happen?
